# Comparing-Classifiers
# Bank Marketing Classification

## Overview
This project's primary goal is to evaluate various classifiers' performance using the Bank Marketing dataset. We will employ K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) as our four classifier models. The goal is to identify the best accurate model for projecting a Portuguese financial institution's marketing campaigns' likelihood of success.

## Summary of Findings
The analysis revealed the following performance metrics for each model:
- K Nearest Neighbor (KNN):
  - Accuracy: 0.899854	
  - F1-Score: 0.891259

- Logistic Regression:
  - Accuracy: 0.910537
  - F1-Score: 0.901383

- Decision Trees:
  - Accuracy: 0.887715
  - F1-Score: 0.887846

- Support Vector Machines (SVM):
  - Accuracy: 0.909565
  - F1-Score: 0.899355

### Best Model
Logistic regression has the highest accuracy, with an F1-score of 0.901383 and an accuracy of 0.910537, based on my observations of the data. We may infer that the Logistic Regression model performs the best based on the model comparison.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The data is from a Portuguese banking institution and includes the results of multiple marketing campaigns conducted via phone calls.
